OpenUpgrade Documentation
=========================

This branch aims to deal with the Openupgrade and openupgradelib documentation
deployed on https://oca.github.io/OpenUpgrade/.

- The main sources are present in the ``docsource`` folder.

- The file ``build_openupgrade_docs`` does the following:

    - fetch the migration coverage files present
      in each branch of the OCA/Openupgrade project and copy them in the ``docsource``
      folder.

    - run the build via ``sphinx`` command and generate the output (html files)
      in the ``docs`` folder.

- The ``docs`` folder so contains autogenerated website that will be displayed
  in the https://oca.github.io/OpenUpgrade/.
